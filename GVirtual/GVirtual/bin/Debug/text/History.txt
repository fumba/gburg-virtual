The study of history challenges students to explore a variety of sources as they gain a greater understanding of the past. The College's expansive history curriculum spans a wide range of periods and developments in the Western and non-Western worlds --from the Age of Discovery in the 15th century to the changing relationship between the United States and the Middle East, from the medieval era to today.

Coursework in history takes place both in and outside the classroom, via classes, research, faculty/student collaboration, and hands-on fieldwork.

Comparing different parts of the world at different periods of time offers insight into the diversity of the human experience as well as one's own place in the world. It is through this process of discovery that the study of history sharpens the mind and leads students toward what can become a lifetime of informed citizenship.
