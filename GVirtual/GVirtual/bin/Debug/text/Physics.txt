Physics at Gettysburg College examines concepts and techniques basic to understanding the fundamental laws of nature, laws that govern the behavior of objects at all scales - from the smallest subatomic particles to the entire observable universe!

Diverse, informed courses emphasize theories and principles that give a broad, unifying description of nature, and numerous opportunities to develop the analytical reasoning needed for their use.

Much of the excitement of physics stems from the process of trying to understand complex physical systems: together, students and faculty explore the interrelationships between matter and energy through astronomy, optics, electromagnetism, elementary particles, relativity, quantum mechanics, and atomic and nuclear physics.

And because experience really is the best teacher, the design of experiments, the techniques of precise measurement, and interpretation of data are explored in fully equipped laboratories. In contrast to programs at most larger institutions, independent study and research with faculty allow students to begin applying their skills early and individually, and exploring their particular interests by their junior and senior years. Each faculty member is dedicated to and actively engaged in teaching and research, and mentoring relationships between faculty and students are the norm rather than the exception.
