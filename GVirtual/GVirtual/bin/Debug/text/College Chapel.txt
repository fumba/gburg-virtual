The Chapel

The Chapel serves as the center for religious and spiritual life at Gettysburg College. Here, we are concerned with the integration of faith and learning. Active student religious groups include Canterbury, Hillel, Muslim Student Association, Newman, Lutheran Student Movement, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and Christian Fellowship. The Chapel also serves as a venue for concerts and lectures.
