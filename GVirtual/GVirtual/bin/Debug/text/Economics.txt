The study of economics is more vital in today's world than ever before.  The exchange of and competition for goods and services -- in the United States and around the world -- influences everything from small-scale community decisions to global geopolitics.

Courses in the Economics Department at Gettysburg College examine economics in both historical and contemporary contexts, drawing on economic theory and exploring how economic forces contribute to contemporary social problems and solutions.
Importantly, economics emphasizes the development of critical thinking. Students learn how to gather information relevant to a particular problem, analyze that information, and synthesize it in ways that lead to new levels of understanding.
A degree in economics builds a foundation for success in a wide range of corporate, nonprofit, and public sector careers, and serves as ideal preparation for graduate work in economics, management, business, law, and other fields.
