Learning German is more than learning a language. It's also the study of a culture and its history. The German program offers a wide range of courses so that the student of German can become proficient in understanding German literature, history, art, and politics in the context of modern society. At all levels, we encourage the partnership between the study of Germany's historical and cultural development and the study of its language.

Courses are offered at all levels, from beginning to advanced, for majors and nonmajors. We encourage all of our students to study on our semester program in Cologne, Germany. On this program, students live with German families, participate in weekly excursions, and study German language, art, political science, literature, and history under the direction of a U.S. faculty member and resident German faculty. In addition, qualified students may study on the Gettysburg College-affiliated, junior-year program at Heidelberg University.

A resident German assistant and various cocurricular activities-films, visiting lecturers, excursions to cultural centers in Washington and Baltimore, German Club-all foster a close working relationship between students and faculty. German television broadcasts are received by a campus-wide satellite system, and in addition to library subscriptions to important journals and newspapers, the department itself maintains subscriptions to newspapers, magazines, and a collection of source materials for use by students and faculty.
