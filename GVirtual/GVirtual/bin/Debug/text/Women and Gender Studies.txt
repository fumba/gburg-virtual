The Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (WGS) Program at Gettysburg College provides opportunities for research and informed activism.

The WGS curriculum emphasizes critical thinking, multiple global perspectives, and the diversity of human experiences through analysis of: the place of women and LGBTQI individuals (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex) in society, including traditionally excluded stories, accomplishments, and experiences; and the intersections of gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, class, age, and ability.

The WGS Program includes courses--both interdisciplinary and in a variety of disciplines such as history, literature, anthropology, sociology, economics, and media studies--that are informed by such perspectives as feminist, queer, and critical race theories. In addition to developing theoretical analyses, students participate in hands-on experiences that involve them in activism. Empowered to use what they learn, students become engaged citizens.
