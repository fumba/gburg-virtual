The Interdisciplinary Studies Program (IDS) offers courses and coordinates specialized interdepartmental programs.  By nature of their objectives and content, IDS courses cross the lines of departments and specialized disciplines. For example, some of these courses attempt to provide the common body of knowledge traditionally associated with a liberal education; others attempt to integrate the understanding of different kinds of subject matter; and still others combine methodologies from diverse departments and disciplines.

Any student may work with IDS to design an individualized major if s/he has a specific objective in mind which cannot be met with any combination of an existing major and minor(s).
