We do not see religion as a list of "isms." Our approach is - and must be - global and cross-cultural:

Many languages have no word for "religion" despite a rich vocabulary devoted to ethics, worldviews, and ways of living.
Belief systems of smaller societies are just as complex as those with broad geographic scope.
Many people find the sacred outside "religion," as in spaces like baseball diamonds, museums, and national parks.
The study of religion encompasses many disciplines, from anthropology to history to art. It fosters skills that are crucial for success in any field: critical thinking, open-mindedness, and communication.

Religious Studies students enter every profession - from law to medicine, from business to non-profit work - and undertake graduate study in a multitude of disciplines.
