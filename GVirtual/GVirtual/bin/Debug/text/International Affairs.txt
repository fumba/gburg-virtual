International Affairs (IA) is offered only as a dual major; therefore, it must be combined with another major.

International Affairs offers students an opportunity to understand the factors and forces that shape the contemporary scene. The program covers all facets of international relations.  Students focus on issues facing the international community, the interdependence of political, social, economic, and environmental factors, and the interactions of states and other actors attempting to achieve their foreign policies or goals. 

The program enables students to gain specialization in the multidisciplinary field of international relations while also developing a strong foundation in a second major field. In recent years, students have combined their IA major with majors in economics, environmental studies, French, German, history, Japanese Studies, management, math, philosophy, political science, sociology, and Spanish. IA majors can also develop a specific regional track, focusing on Latin America, Europe, Africa, or Asia.

Students who graduate with an IA major are well prepared to pursue careers in the international arena, whether they choose to enter the professional world following graduation or go on to graduate school.
