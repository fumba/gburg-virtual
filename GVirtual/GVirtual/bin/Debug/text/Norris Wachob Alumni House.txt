Norris Wachob Alumni House

The Norris-Wachob Alumni House, known for years as the White House, was built in 1860 as a home for the College's president. Starting in 1952, it served as home to the Political Science Department and classroom space, until renovated and rededicated in 2004 as the Alumni House. It is named for Tom '60 and Joan (Wachob) '60 Norris. Today, the Alumni House hosts a variety of programs and events and serves as a "home on campus" to alumni.
