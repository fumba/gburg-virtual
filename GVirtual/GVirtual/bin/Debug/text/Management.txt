The Department of Management offers a major in Organization and Management Studies (OMS) and a minor in Business, which integrate the study of these important fields into the liberal arts and sciences.

The OMS major explores organizations, how they behave within the context of societal issues, how people in those organizations behave, and how those organizations are managed. Students gain a strong foundation in organization theory and behavior, statistics, research methods, and systems thinking.

The major is anchored in the social sciences, and reaffirms the central role of the liberal arts in studies of organizations and management. Critical thinking, rigorous inquiry, and the acquisition of knowledge-instead of just skills-are central to the OMS curriculum. The curriculum stresses intellectual boldness, creative problem solving, entrepreneurial thinking, and the practice of responsible management. It is an ideal major for anyone aspiring to a management or leadership position in business, government, the nonprofit sector, or any other organizational environment.
