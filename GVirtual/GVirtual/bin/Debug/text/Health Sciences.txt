The Health Sciences program takes a multidisciplinary approach to the study of the human body. Starting with a liberal arts foundation, Health Science integrates the study of biology, chemistry, and physics along with courses focusing on the science of the human body in conditions of health and disease. These include: Human anatomy and physiology, Neuromuscular physiology, Cardiorespiratory physiology, Exercise physiology, Environmental physiology, Chronic diseases, Nutrition, Health assessment, Kinesiology, Public health, Global health, and Epidemiology.

Health Sciences students also gain invaluable hands-on experience by participating in internships in a variety of professional environments, such as physical therapy, nursing, medicine, physician assistant, and dentistry. Many students do independent research, often resulting in presentations at scientific meetings and co-authored papers with faculty members.

Health Sciences majors also have a strong record of career success in the nation's leading professional schools in the health professions, including physical therapy, physician assistant, medicine, nursing, dentistry, and many other fields.
