Theatre Arts students at Gettysburg explore the theatrical event as a complex unit - one that is founded in literary and historical roots, and then translated into performance through the work of playwrights, actors, directors, and designers.

The theatre curriculum includes: acting, directing, playwriting, design, history and literature of theatre, and the relationship of theatre to other aspects of culture and society.

Theatre arts programs at Gettysburg also offer a variety of creative and technical experiences, from 10-Minute Play Festivals to Lunchtime Theatre, to participation in Main Stage Performances. What's more, the study of theatre arts offers excellent preparation for a variety of careers - both within and outside the discipline.
