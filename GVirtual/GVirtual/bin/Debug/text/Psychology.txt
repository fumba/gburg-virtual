The Psychology Department emphasizes an empirical approach to psychology - one based on observation and experience that, in turn, builds the skills needed to think through the challenges of the field.

Coursework includes psychology classes, advanced laboratories, independent research, opportunities for internships and service learning, fieldwork, seminars, and exploration of special projects.
Courses, lab work, and other activities promote knowledge of the causes of behavior and mental processes . . . while helping develop a scientific attitude and an appreciation for the complexity of human personality.
Through the study of psychology, students gain direct experience with the major methods, instruments, and theoretical frameworks of the discipline.
The breadth of experiences in the Psychology Department are a major reason why graduates are routinely accepted to the nation's leading graduate programs - in fact, more than half of the department's graduates go on to graduate school. 

As a whole, students of psychology at Gettysburg College aren't simply "given the answers" - rather, they are given the tools that enable them to ask the questions.
