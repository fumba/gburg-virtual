Science Center / McCreary

This building contains teaching labs which integrate computers into the laboratory and allow web access in the classroom. The Science Center houses biochemistry, chemistry, environmental studies, health sciences, and neuroscience, and includes a greenhouse, a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (NMR), and a Geographical Information System (GIS) lab.
Home to both biology and psychology, McCreary Hall provides an ideal learning environment. In addition to the latest in equipment for biology - fume hoods, a modern deionized pure water system, and lots of data ports for interactive work - there is an infant research lab, space for cognitive neuroscience, and a vivarium (animal facility).

This building is open 24/7.
