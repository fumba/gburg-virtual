Asia, home to a majority of the world's population and birthplace of some of the world's oldest cultures, provides a geographical focal point for a wide variety of courses offered at Gettysburg College. These courses are taught both by members of the Asian Studies Department and by faculty in other academic departments.

A full four years of Japanese language courses are offered, and there are opportunities to study at more advanced levels on an individual or small group basis. At present, three years of Chinese language courses are offered. 

In addition to language study, students may pursue one of four programs: a major in Japanese studies, a major in Chinese studies, a minor in Japanese studies, or a minor in East Asian studies. For students interested in other parts of Asia, a number of relevant courses are regularly available in other departments.
