Breidenbaugh Hall

Fully renovated in 2004, Breidenbaugh Hall is home to the English department and Asian Studies. It also houses a modern foreign language center, as well as the Joseph Theater, a 103-seat theater with state-of-the-art sound and projection capabilities. First opened in 1927, the building was named for former chemistry professor Edward Breidenbaugh; it housed the chemistry department for nearly 80 years.
