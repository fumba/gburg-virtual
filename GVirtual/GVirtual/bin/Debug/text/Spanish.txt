The ability to speak and understand a language other than one's own, and to have insight into the artistic and cultural heritage of other peoples of the world, is considered an integral part of a liberal arts education. The department, through a strong core of basic courses, gives students facility in the use of spoken and written Spanish and some knowledge of its literature and cultural history. The communicative method of modern language teaching is stressed in the classroom.

Advanced-level courses in literature, linguistics, and civilization are designed to give students an understanding and appreciation of the literature, language, and cultures of the Hispanic peoples. Students are encouraged to study in a Spanish-speaking country, and opportunities are offered through study abroad programs with approved colleges and through cooperative agreements with the International University Studies in Seville, Spain; I.E.S. at the University of Salamanca, Spain; the Universal Language Institute in Cuernavaca, Mexico; and Butler University programs in Argentina (Buenos Aires, Mendoza) and Merida, Yucatan (Mexico). As a part of their study abroad experience, students participate in several orientation meetings at the College before leaving. Upon students' return, the Spanish Department provides a series of reintegration meetings. These pre- and post-travel sessions enhance students' experiences.

Courses in the department provide sound preparation for graduate study, teaching, or careers in government, business, or social work. The department works cooperatively with the Department of Education in the preparation of Spanish teachers. Since the largest minority group in the United States is Spanish speaking, the department feels that a knowledge of Spanish and an understanding of the Hispanic cultures is of increasing importance.
