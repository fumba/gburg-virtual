Courses and programs in the Education Department integrate a strong background in educational philosophy and theory with classroom practice and other field experiences to prepare you to become a school teacher at the K-12 level.

We do not offer a major in education. Instead, those interested in teaching careers major in another liberal arts discipline and complete the necessary education requirements to earn certification.

Hands-on classroom experience through student teaching and other activities is a fundamental part of your learning. You will develop units of instruction, prepare and teach lessons, tutor children, and, in your capstone project, student teach-which you can do in neighboring school districts or an urban environment.

Our programs qualify students for Pennsylvania Instructional I Certification in: Secondary education in sciences, social sciences, English, and mathematics, K-12 music, French, German, Latin, and Spanish.

The certifications may be transferred to many states with standards similar to Pennsylvania's.
