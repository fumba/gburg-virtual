McKnight Hall

Built in 1898 as a dormitory for men, McKnight Hall today is home to the Departments of French, German, Italian, and Spanish. (Asian languages are taught in Breidenbaugh Hall.) Faculty offices, classrooms and language resource rooms are all in McKnight; a state-of-the art language resource center, located in Breidenbaugh, complements language instruction at Gettysburg.
