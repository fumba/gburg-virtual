The visual arts department has the following major objectives: to promote the creation and study of visual arts as a vital aspect of a liberal arts education, to study how and why works of art are made, and why art has played such a significant role in cultures and societies across time and space, and to prepare majors as future artists or scholars in the fields of Studio Art or Art History as well as to position them to enhance any professional endeavor with intellectual curiosity and creativity.

The department offers a flexible program of study in interrelated studio and art history courses, with potential majors in two areas, art history and studio art. The department encourages students from disciplines other than art to select from both types of courses.
