Globalization is a multifaceted phenomenon that is making the world more complex and more interconnected culturally, politically, linguistically, and economically. The multidisciplinary major in globalization studies integrates perspectives from the humanities, social sciences, arts, and natural sciences.

The major consists of required courses and two tracks that students design themselves. One is a regional track and the other a thematic track that examines a topic with global implications such as justice, conflict, the environment, or human rights. Students must complete both tracks. All majors study abroad, and each collaborates closely with faculty on a capstone research project that addresses a global-scale challenge.

Because the two tracks are self-designed, students must complete an application for the major that specifies their course selections. Applications for the Globalization Studies major must be completed no later than fall of the junior year.
