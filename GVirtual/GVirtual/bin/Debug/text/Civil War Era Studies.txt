Gettysburg College's unique location affords our students the grand opportunity to study for four years in America's Premier Civil War Classroom. Created in 1998 with funding from the Henry R. Luce Foundation, CWES oversees an undergraduate minor in Civil War Era Studies and a "Gettysburg Semester," which affords undergraduates from outside Gettysburg College an opportunity to spend an entire "immersion" semester in Civil War studies at Gettysburg.

The study of the battles, personalities and ideas which shaped our nation during the tumultuous years around the American Civil War extends deep into our college's history, with some of our professors embarking upon studying the maelstrom which unfolded around them while the smoke of battle was still settling.  The college's buildings and grounds were witness to one of the largest field hospitals on the battlefield, and its students in November of 1863 witnessed the speech made Abraham Lincoln in the National Cemetery.

Our students are afforded today with an equally rich experience, not only in our own town, but with the myriad research and study opportunities that are a stone's throw away from our campus.
