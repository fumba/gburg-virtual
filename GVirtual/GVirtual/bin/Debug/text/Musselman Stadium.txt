Musselman Stadium

Dedicated in September 1965, Musselman Stadium is the home to Gettysburg football, men's lacrosse and men's and women's outdoor track & field. In September 2003, Shirk Field at Musselman Stadium was converted from natural grass to AstroPlay, a state-of-the-art in-fill synthetic grass surface. The renovation was made possible through the generosity of Dick Shirk '67, for whom the field is named.
